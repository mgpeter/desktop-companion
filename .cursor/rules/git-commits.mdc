      Git Commit Message Standards:

      1. Subject Line (First Line):
         - Maximum 72 characters
         - Start with a capital letter
         - No period at the end
         - Use imperative mood ("Add" not "Added")
         - Complete sentence
         - Examples:
           ```
           Add OpenAI integration service
           Implement voice activity detection
           Fix webcam frame capture timing
           ```

      2. Body (After Blank Line):
         - Separate from subject with blank line
         - Wrap at 72 characters
         - Explain what and why, not how
         - Reference issues when relevant
         - Examples:
           ```
           Add OpenAI integration service

           Implement OpenAI service integration to handle text generation
           and speech synthesis. This enables the servo-skull to provide
           context-aware responses using the latest GPT models.

           - Add OpenAI client with retry policies
           - Configure proper API key management
           - Implement response caching
           - Add rate limiting protection

           Closes #123
           ```

      3. Breaking Changes:
         - Start with "BREAKING CHANGE:"
         - Explain what changed and why
         - Example:
           ```
           Update API client structure

           BREAKING CHANGE: Move API clients to separate integration
           projects for better separation of concerns. This change
           requires updating service registration in Startup.cs.
           ```

      4. Common Patterns:
         - Feature additions: "Add [feature]"
         - Bug fixes: "Fix [issue]"
         - Refactoring: "Refactor [component]"
         - Performance: "Optimize [component]"
         - Documentation: "Update [docs]"

examples:
  - input: |
      feat: add openai integration

      // Bad: Missing body, uses conventional commit type
    output: "Incorrect commit message format"
